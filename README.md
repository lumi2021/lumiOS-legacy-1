# LUMI OS

My experiments with OS dev.

It includes :
- A kernel (obviously lol);
- A library for aplications;
- A little graphics API;
- (very raw) Device support;
- Some processes that runs at ring 0;
- A simple file system;
- Wallpapers

obs: don't expect anything above working 100% :3

It works on virtual machines
